Examples of mapfiles

Example 1:

N4R32_r3 - An example custom mapfile for 4 nodes with 32 cores/node and s:a ratio of 3:1
Total number of cores = 128
M=96, N=32
The simulation ranks (0:95) are placed on first 24 cores of each of the 4 nodes
The analysis ranks (96:127) are placed on last 8 cores of each of the 4 nodes
