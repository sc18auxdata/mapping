Below are some examples of mapfiles. We use Python scripts to generate these mapfiles, based on the architecture, #nodes, #cores/node and s:a ratio.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 1: Cray systems (Theta/Cori)

Cray_N4R32_3

An example custom mapfile for 4 nodes with 32 cores/node and s:a ratio of 3:1
Total number of cores = 128
M=96, N=32
Each line represents ordered core numbers (0:31) on each node. Value in each line is the rank placed on the corresponding core.
In this mapping, the simulation ranks (0:95) are placed on first 24 cores of each of the 4 nodes, and the analysis ranks (96:127) are placed on last 8 cores of each of the 4 nodes.

To use this mapfile, set MPICH_RANK_REORDER_METHOD=3, and rename/copy Cray_N4R32_3 to MPICH_RANK_ORDER file.

Example 2: BG/Q systems (Mira)

BGQ_N512R16_3  

An example custom mapfile for 512 nodes with 16 cores/node and s:a ratio of 3:1
Total number of cores = 8192
M=6144, N=2048
Each line represents the rank number. Values in each line are the torus coordinates <A,B,C,D,E,T> of the rank number, which represents the core on which the rank is placed.
In this mapping, the simulation ranks (0:6143) are placed on first 12 cores of each node, and the analysis ranks (6144:8191) are placed on last 4 cores of each node.

To use this mapfile, set RUNJOB_MAPPING to BGQ_N512R16_3 in the job command line.
